            "answer": "Step 7 is the process of securing the attachment between two frames of the bed frame. Since attaching two frames with nut sleeves is not secure, step 7 indicates using a wheel lock and securing with a hex wrench."

            "answer": "At the top left of the picture, the assembly materials for assembly at this stage, such as screws, are diagrammed. Step 13 uses two additional diagonal braces to assemble the bed frame, creating an X-shape within the rectangle for added stability. An additional step is to secure it with screws to the edge of the bed."

            "answer": "Steps 14 and 15 are part of the assembly process for the bed. In Step 14, the bed's legs were lying flat, facing upward, but in Step 15, they are standing upright in the correct position. Additionally, at the top of Step 15, there are images showing the bed being flipped over and a frame being added to support the mattress, indicating that between these two steps, the bed was flipped, and an additional frame was added and secured to support the mattress."

            "question": "What happened to the furniture during step 5 (page 7) and step 6 (page 8)? What is changed?",
            "answer": "In Step 5, assemble the top and bottom frames of the bed by turning the cam wheel locks (serial part number 115349) clockwise using the hex wrench. After completing Step 5, proceed to Step 6 to connect the upper and lower frames and side frames assembled in Step 5 using wooden dowel (serial part number 101352)."

            "question": "What would be the short-term or long-term consequences if step 1 (page 4) is omitted during assembly?",
            "answer": "Step 1 represents inserting the screws (serial number 115348) into the leg of the bed. Since these screws are tightened with wheel locks at step 4 (page 6), if these steps are omitted, the leg part and bed frames are not securely tightened."
        },
        {
            "question": "What would be the short-term or long-term consequences if step 12 (page 13) is omitted during assembly?",
            "answer": "Step 12 is the step of fixing the x-band to the bed with screws. The x-band plays a role in helping bear the load of the bed. If this step is omitted, the bed may easily collapse if an object or person with a heavy load is placed on it."
