            "question": "What would be the short-term or long-term consequences if step 7 (page 9) is omitted during assembly?",
            "answer": "Step 7 is the step of connecting the floor lids to each leg to prevent the toddler bed from slipping easily due to external shock or weight. If this step is omitted, the child may easily slip while lying on the toddler bed, which could be dangerous to the child."
