    "wo_annot_common" : "You are an AI visual assistant, and you are seeing at sequential images which are instructional images to assist with assembling furniture. Assembly process are divided into multiple steps, with one or several steps per page (image). On the first page of the assembly manual, the name of the furniture and an image of the completed furniture are provided. The following pages contain diagrams detailing important considerations for assembly (such as whether assembly can be done alone or if a rug needs to be placed on the floor), followed by the necessary parts, quantities, and six-digit part numbers. Subsequent pages depict the assembly process through illustrations, with bold numbers in the top left corner indicating the step and thin numbers at the top or bottom left corner indicating the page number. The speech bubbles in the manual offer guidance by magnifying the assembly methods. Since the assembly process is depicted entirely through pictures, one must infer the meaning of the current step's illustration while referencing the assembly steps before and after. Answer all questions as you are seeing the images.\n",

    "cat1" : "Design a question-and-answer session about a specific step in these assembly images. When responding to a question, it is necessary to consider not only the step asked, but also refer to the finished product, surrounding steps, and the overall assembly process. When including information about steps other than those asked in the question, it is essential to specify which step it is. Only information clearly visible in the image should be used in the response, and answers should not rely on uncertain information.\n",
    "cat2" : "Design a question-and-answer session about an assembly diagram or a set of assembly diagrams at a specified location in these assembly images. Assembly diagrams are enclosed in rectangular boxes without tails rather than in the shape of speech bubbles. Assembly diagrams contain additional and detailed information to aid understanding of the respective step, to depict the expanded functionality of a product or specific component, or to differentiate the parts used in the step. When responding to a question, it is necessary to provide detailed explanations of how the assembly diagram assists in the specific step and how it aids in the progression of that step. Only information clearly visible in the images should be used in the response, and answers should not rely on uncertain information.\n",
    "cat3" : "Design a question-and-answer session to reason about the changes and correlations between two consecutive steps in these assembly images. When responding to a question, it is necessary to explain what the steps are for in the overall process and describe the sequential and causal differences correlated between the previous and subsequent steps. Only information clearly visible in the images should be used in the response, and answers should not rely on uncertain information.\n",
    "cat4" : "Design a question-and-answer session about an error prevention diagram or a set of error prevention diagrams at a specified location in these assembly images. Error prevention diagrams are enclosed in rectangular boxes with an X mark indicating prohibition and may include a triangle with an exclamation mark to indicate caution or a circle with an alphabet 'i' to indicate information. When responding to a question, it is necessary to provide detailed explanations of potentially hazardous situations that may occur in the respective step or the possibility of damage to the components and prohibited actions in response to these risks or distinguish between parts that are not used in the respective step. Only information clearly visible in the images should be used in the response, and answers should not rely on uncertain information.\n",
    "cat5" : "Design a question-and-answer session to infer all steps involved in a specific action occurring in the assembly process in these assembly images. When responding to a question, it is necessary to accurately infer all the relevant steps and the respective pages each step is contained within. Only information clearly visible in the images should be used in the response, and answers should not rely on uncertain information.\n",
